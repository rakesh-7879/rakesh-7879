        "answer": "With whatever we can. Preparing cost analysis, establishing team roles, creating roadmaps. Defining business goals, key business values, target users, main features, prioritising.

We can assist you with creating user personas, mock-ups, user stories, time frame, establishing project status and preparing project estimation. We'll be happy to outline project specification, prepare wireframes, details concerning integrations with external services, API documentation, required features list."

        "question": "How do We create a product with you?",
        "answer": "If you have an idea contact us by our online form, e-mail or phone. We'll meet and talk it over. Just be sure to prepare as much info about your idea as possible, it will smoothen the meeting and benefit further cooperation. If you don't know how to get around to it, go ahead and read any blog entry on 'how to write a project brief.'"

    {
        "question": "Should I create a mobile or a web app?",
        "answer": "Both have their benefits and flaws. Mobile apps are surely more expensive but can provide you with many more data collecting, monetisation capabilities than web applications. Progressive Web Apps are a good compromise between a mobile and web app. But remember that sooner or later you may need both mobile and web app and when that moment comes we are here for you :)"

    {
        "question": "What do I need to know before contacting you?",
        "answer": "Well, the most important thing to know is what do you want to accomplish. Why do I need this software? What for? What should it do? Having a clear vision in mind is crucial when ordering a software application. You don't want to spend many months developing it with us without being sure what you need. We'll also be glad to help you get started, building projects from scratch is nothing new for us."
